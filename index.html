The density and the diversity. New York City is, by far, the densest city in the United States- and that includes the outer boroughs. Manhattan alone is one of the densest urban areas in the world, especially in the developed world. (The only comparable place I've been in the so-called 'first world' is Hong Kong, which is a whole other story). <br> <br> People think of Manhattan as a rich person's territory- justifiably- but bear in mind that there's Harlem, and Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights, as well as a multitude of areas with a lot of working-class and middle-class people. Because of this geographic compression and a flat-rate subway, New York's various populations mix and mingle more than those in many other cities.</p>
